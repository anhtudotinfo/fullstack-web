            Registration is free and always will be. All you have to do is to 
            simply create an account and you will be given unique account numbers in which
            the platform will use for crypto-mining.

            There are basically 3 unique plans in which users can choose from and

            until it expires.

            The timeout intervals are used whenever users deposit funds into their bank accounts
            and also when they convert their crypto-currency earnings directly into U$D. 
            Currently the timeout interval is set to 1-day.
